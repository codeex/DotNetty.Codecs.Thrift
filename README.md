DotNetty Codes Lib for Thrift


About Apache Thrift
============

Thrift is a lightweight, language-independent software stack with an
associated code generation mechanism for point-to-point RPC. Thrift provides 
clean abstractions for data transport, data serialization, and application
level processing. The code generation system takes a simple definition
language as input and generates code across programming languages that
uses the abstracted stack to build interoperable RPC clients and servers.

![Apache Thrift Layered Architecture](https://github.com/apache/thrift/raw/master/doc/images/thrift-layers.png)

Thrift makes it easy for programs written in different programming
languages to share data and call remote procedures.  With support 
for [25 programming languages](LANGUAGES.md), chances are Thrift 
supports the languages that you currently use.

Thrift is specifically designed to support non-atomic version changes
across client and server code.

For more details on Thrift's design and implementation, see the Thrift
whitepaper included in this distribution, or at the README.md file
in your particular subdirectory of interest.
